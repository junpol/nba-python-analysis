# nba-python-analysis
This project explores how different NBA player stats relate to each other using raw CSV data and a manually coded correlation function (Pearson coefficient). I chose not to use libraries like NumPy or Pandas to reinforce my understanding of core Python, algorithm design, and real-world data cleaning.

# What It Does:
 - Loads raw 2024 NBA season stats from a CSV file
 - Cleans and parses numeric data from key columns

# Calculates the correlation between:
- 3-Point Percentage (3P%) and Points Per Game (PPG)
- Age (AGE) and Minutes Per Game (MPG)
- Free Throw Attempts (FTA) and Free Throw Percentage (FT%)

Includes manual test cases to validate correlation logic

# Why I Built This!
- I wanted to sharpen my data analysis and core algorithm skills by building everything from the ground up â€” no shortcuts. This project reflects:
- My comfort with intermediate-level Python (functions, loops, control flow)
- My ability to structure clean, testable code
- My interest in data-driven storytelling (especially through sports)
